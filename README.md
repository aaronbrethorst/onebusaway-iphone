### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/#OneBusAway/conduct@onebusaway.org). By participating, you are expected to honor this code.

### Picking an appropriate first-time issue

You are welcome to work on any bug or feature you would like, but we know that getting started in a new codebase can be intimidating. To that end, we recommend that you take a look at issues labeled as [Your First PR](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-iphone/labels/Your%20First%20PR). These issues are relatively small and self-contained, and should be perfect for anyone who is interested in getting their feet wet with the OneBusAway codebase.

(h/t to Microsoft's [ChakraCore](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore) project for the idea of the first PR)

### Development environment setup

1. Install Xcode 8.0.x
2. `git clone` your fork
3. install Carthage - see [carthage github repo](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for instructions, and you can download the latest release at https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases
4. `open org.onebusaway.iphone.xcodeproj`

You should now be able to build. See our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the specific workflow to add a new feature or bug fix.
